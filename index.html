          <span>Cobb salad:</span> the salad that sure doesn't feel like one. It's stuffed with chicken, bacon, avocado, eggs and cheese. The only way to make this dish heavier is to add bricks.
          Stories about the first Cobb salad abound: Some say it was created at the Hollywood Brown Derby restaurant, owned by Robert Howard Cobb. According to legend, Cobb hadn't eaten until midnight, so he mixed together some leftovers he found in the kitchen.

         <span>In case you were wondering what Lao's national dish is made out of, here's a hint:</span> it comes from a Lanna (northern Thailand) word that literally means "to mince meat." But there's more to the salad than just meat. It's traditional to stir fry and add the blood of the chicken or pig that ended up in this most carnivore-friendly salad imaginable. It's usually served with raw vegetables and sticky rice.
